Once we start our  web application, a worker service will be created in the background waiting for certain events.
Now the server (ex: Nodejs Web Api) will send/PUSH some events to the worker service.
The server has two keys : Public key and a private key(The last one is only known by the server) (This is an asymmetric encryption).

In the server app, i added some packages: express, dotenv, Cors, body-parser and web-push.
-Web-push is a package that allows a JavaScript code that lives in a Nodejs Application to send push notifications.
-Express is a package that allows us to do a webserver.
-Body-Parser  parses the JSON, string and URL encoded data submitted using HTTP POST request.
-Cors is to allow cross origin resource sharing.


Make sure to have nodejs installed on your machine.

In order to run the app, first of all navigate inside the main folder.
After that navigate into the server folder using the CLI and hit : " npm install " in order to install all the packages.
also navigate into the client app and do the same thing "npm install"

now open 2 CLIs and navigate to client-app and to server-app
in the client- app CLI run : npm start
in the server-app CLI run : node index.js

finally open the browser and navigate to localhost:3000 
to test it using postman make a new  POST request and in the urls type : localhost:9000/notifications/subscribe and in the body 
copy the endpoint in the server-app cli after that his send.
a notification will popup.
