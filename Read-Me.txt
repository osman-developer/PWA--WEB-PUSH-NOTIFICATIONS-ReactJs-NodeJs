Once we start our  web application, a worker service will be created in the background waiting for certain events.
Now the server (ex: Nodejs Web Api) will send/PUSH some events to the worker service.
The server has two keys : Public key and a private key(The last one is only known by the server) (This is an asymmetric encryption).

In the server app, i added some packages: express, dotenv, Cors, body-parser and web-push.
-Web-push is a package that allows a JavaScript code that lives in a Nodejs Application to send push notifications.
-Express is a package that allows us to do a webserver.
-Body-Parser  parses the JSON, string and URL encoded data submitted using HTTP POST request.
-Cors is to allow cross origin resource sharing.


Make sure to have nodejs installed on your machine.

In order to run the app, first of all navigate inside the main folder.
After that navigate into the server folder using the CLI and hit : " npm install " in order to install all the packages.
